# GitHub Agents

This directory contains expert agent definitions for specialized development tasks in the CogFin project.

## Available Agents

### cogfin-expert.md
Expert agent for CogFin cognitive financial intelligence subsystem development.

**Expertise Areas:**
- OpenCog cognitive architecture (AtomSpace, pattern matching)
- Tensor-enhanced accounting (multi-entity, multi-scale, network-aware)
- Hybrid symbolic-neural AI (ATenSpace)
- Financial domain modeling (categorization, anomaly detection, predictions)

**When to Use:**
- Developing or modifying OpenCog cognitive features
- Adding tensor-based financial analysis capabilities
- Implementing AI-powered transaction insights
- Enhancing pattern detection and prediction systems
- Working with the AtomSpace knowledge base
- Tensor operations and multi-dimensional accounting

## How to Use Agents

Agents are specialized assistants that can be invoked by AI tools to handle domain-specific development tasks. Each agent markdown file contains:

1. **Domain expertise** - Deep knowledge of specific subsystems
2. **Architecture understanding** - How components fit together
3. **Best practices** - Coding patterns and conventions
4. **Common tasks** - Step-by-step guides for typical modifications
5. **Integration points** - How to connect with other systems

## Adding New Agents

When creating a new agent:

1. Create a markdown file with descriptive name (e.g., `ui-expert.md`, `report-expert.md`)
2. Include comprehensive domain knowledge
3. Provide code examples and patterns
4. Document key files and their purposes
5. Explain integration with rest of system
6. List common development tasks with solutions
7. Update this README with the new agent

## Agent Guidelines

Good agents should:
- Have deep, specialized knowledge in their domain
- Provide practical, actionable guidance
- Include code examples
- Reference specific files and functions
- Explain architectural decisions
- Guide both beginners and experts
- Be maintained as the codebase evolves

## Future Agents

Potential agents for CogFin development:

- **ui-expert.md** - GTK/GNOME UI development, GtkBuilder, user interactions
- **report-expert.md** - Scheme-based reports, HTML generation, financial statements
- **engine-expert.md** - Core accounting engine, transactions, splits, commodities
- **import-export-expert.md** - File format handling (QIF, OFX, CSV)
- **testing-expert.md** - Test framework, mocking, coverage
- **build-expert.md** - CMake, dependencies, cross-platform builds
- **i18n-expert.md** - Internationalization, translations, localization
